Informal Meeting with: Judge Aiken, Lina Kaisey, Dazza Greenwood, Dan Lear, Josh from Clio, Eric Adler, Doc Searle, Mrs. ?? Searle 

Date: 1/8/2014
 
* Terminology
- "Computational social science" = Build a model of a system with inputs and outputs; develop hypotheses;  test with empirical data. 
- Participants = parolees participating in re-entry program.
- "Re-entry Court" = 
- "Intense supervision" == 1 meeting per month with parole officer. 
Need much more time and interactions, and 

* Big Picture Goals
- VISION - Accountability and hope; transparency, truth, trust
- Define "family" and "values" in terms of data and and tell compelling stories to convince congress/public to direct funds towards most effective policies/services. 
- Teach participants about the value/benefits of being a member of society; what they will lose if they return to drugs/crime/prison. 
- Bureau of prisons wants data. 
- What's the metric we're seeking for "justice"? 
- Fed. Cir journal - Who's going back to prison? Major violations or technical violations? We want to solve minor technical problems without sending people back to prison. 
- Policy Proposal - Incentivize keeping people in the community. Communities receive *more* money for sending *fewer* people to prison. 

** Payload: Goal is get economic data to congress/Gov't. 
What is the data we need? 
- We need to identify participant's problems AND attach them to a public service. 
- "Predictive Risk Scores" based on 5 criminogenic issues: 
1. Substance Abuse 
2. Education
3. Mental Health 
4. Family Abuse. 
5. Jobs 

- Current Solution (pre-app) - Participants are texting directly with judge and parole officer. 
- - [Example.... one participant sent consistent positive messages for weeks, the just texted "help". This is the scenario for "crisis" button.]
- Some people say that shorter prison sentences and longer supervision is a more efficient strategy for correcting criminal behavior. 

* Features
** Features - Participant Interface
- crisis button: [UI Note - put it in upper right corner (easy access; most people are righties]. 

- Communication/Social interactions between participants, parole officers, case workers, judge. ["Not rating people out, but calling for help."] 
- Dashboard for probation officers to get high-level, important info. Like a HEAT MAP of their highest risk participants. 
- Needs modules for localization? 

* Tactics 
- Peer-to-peer incentives can provide powerful incentives. [not quite like guilt/shame.]
- High-risk Offenders - Identify and help them first because they're "busting budgets" everywhere. 
- Compare to NYPD's J-RIP program in Brooklyn  - "Juvenile Robbery Intervention Program" 
- - Detectives identify high-risk youth; monitor their social media pages; and "At the same time, officers seek to forge relationships with the teenagerâs family..."

* Method and Mechanism - 4 Questions [~Dazza]: 
1. People? 
2. Interactions? 
3. Data? 
4. Systems? 

** People / Users / Roles
Who's using it? Who's involved? 
- Goes to *probation office* to sort. 
- Treatment provider 
- Education? Contacts at community college. 
- institutional players? 
- Mental Health
- Housing
- Drug testing providers - did they miss their UAs? First sign that people are falling off is that their missing their UAs. 
- just need to connect - just need a friend? Can we allow them to talk to each other? Felons to felons? Appropriate peer support? 

- Users = "Participant"
- - 4th grade education, vision issues, brain damage, fetal alcohol, etc. 
- Relationship Problems - can't build an intimate relationship. They don't know what its supposed to look like how it should work. 


** Interactions? 
- Call for help? e.g., Where's the closest clinic? 
- Medical Needs - how to address them; who to talk to. 
- Drug seeking behaviors. ("another person in the ER with drug seeking behaviors")
- Kids - kids crisis causes parents to start using again. 
- Tells medical providers that this person is part of the reentry program. 

- Scheduling is a major point. 
- Tutorials - how to get a drivers license, etc. most participants are driving without a license. Can get include a little instruction manual? 
- - Can an interaction be triggered by an external person? like a non-re-entry person? 
- - Secure point-to-point messaging; anonymous? Anonymous for the non-felons? Should Parol officer have access to these point-to-point communications ? 

- Urinalysis - not a button but a notification that the participant needs to go get a test. [is this correct?]

- Example Feature - Sort out fines and debt. Some participants think they have much bigger debts/fines/etc. than they actually owe. They don't even know how to find and add up the separate minor fines for driving violations etc. 

** Visualizations - data viz is important to judge. 
** "Phased" treatment programs - slowly reduce drug use vs. cold turkey. 

- Two Zones App [Dazza Proposal] - One part accessible to probation officers, and anther with a partial zone of privacy. ???? interrupted by phone call. Are there 2 sister apps? One that's more personal? 

Participant needs to see their own data. See their progress. 
*Phone data* is ideal for this because phone metadata is all about *personal relationships*. 

** Health Triangle - (from DARPA PST program)
1. Sociability  - are they talking to people? Hanging out in groups? 
2. Physical ? 
3. ??? 



* Questions
How public is the judges files? Its the court's private files? how private? What statute?? 

* Schedule 
- Chief judges meeting in San Diego next week - 2 presentations on diversion courts? Thurs and Friday. 


* Quotes/Paraphrases: 
- Not "re-entry" because these guys have never actually been part of society. 
- "Appellate court is reviewing for legal error, but no one is reviewing for empirical data." 
- Metaphor - Current re-entry model is like a doctor telling diabetic to eat right, exercise, etc. Good intentioned, but normal humans can't stick to these rules without some kind of help.  
- "sentinels of civilization"
- "exercise and instructions designed to alter dysfunctional thinking processes" [?]

* People to Meet / Talk to / Etc. 
- Wilson Compton - MD PhD at NIH - says 18 mo to 36 until the addicted brain retrains itself to normal chemical state. 
- Melissa Aubin - maubit@supremecourt.gov ?? 
She knows where the data is. 
- Mark Sherman - knows every judge in the country doing this work. 
- Mark Sherman at FJC? Make sure its about the entire project, not just about Oregon - needs to b generic for use throughout the country. 
- Bearl Shiller? Art III judge in Philly. 
- Leo Sorokin - magistrate judge - As opposed to Aiken who uses a concrete 1-year no-drug-use program.
