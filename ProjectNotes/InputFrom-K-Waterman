Two quick thoughts re: privacy for the phone the Judge envisions:

Who can access the data the device collects?  
If the app is on a regular phone, should it block their ability to download other apps or use it for other communications
Upside – better integration in the community
Downside privacy risk – most apps are picking up “all contacts” on the phone and all parties with whom they’ve communicated – meaning fBook or whomever would have deep and personal information relating to the person’s justice-supported activities
Privacy of the data collected by the supporting agencies
I have spoken to others with similar projects; they are concerned about how data is shared among the supporting agencies (think: restrictions on conviction data, health data, mental health data, children’s privacy, etc)
How will this phone app sub-divide the stream of info to appropriate agencies, or will it tackle the intersection of privacy laws problem

Hope this helps!  -k

Hi, Dazza & Lina,  I’m in the airport for about 2 hours and want to help.  Can you Skype / Google+ me in?  Let me know what you’re up to for the Judge’s project…I have some ideas about how to fold in the privacy piece.  Thanks, -k
