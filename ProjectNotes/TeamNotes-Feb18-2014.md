## Email Update From Dan:

Hi Everyone,
 
In anticipation of our call today I put together a short summary of the project which I shared with you on Google Drive. I see two uses for this:
 
1)      The contact at the Ford Foundation asked for something she could share with the individuals who handle criminal justice programs at Ford. I wanted to have us start to think about what that might look like.

2)      I also thought it would be helpful to have something to provide to the judge. She could review it, give us feedback, and generally give us an idea about next steps.

 
It’s very much a work in progress – and I welcome your feedback and changes –  but I hope it will both help us to focus on what we’re doing (not that we’re losing focus) with the project but also give us something that can be shared with external people to educate them on the project.
 
Looking forward to chatting.
 
Dan
