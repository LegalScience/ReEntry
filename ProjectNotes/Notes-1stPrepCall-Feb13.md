Round the Horn on Perspectives on How Best to Move Forward:

1. Dazza: Suggest we do the (now current first draft) statement in the GitHub repo PLUS a healthy amount of prototypes (MIT UROPS and partners etc) 
- These are UROPS: http://web.mit.edu/urop/ 

2. Dan: Need to build some code and there is an opportunity to get some funding and resources to make progress.  Let's do that.  
SECOND ROUND:
- What are short term goals and longer term goal and how do we move that way?
- Need subject matter experts to work with us and also we need to do some work to get up to speed (interview, learn, etc).  

3. Joyce: Key is to develop as much as possible bottom up and light weight, not a big vendor.  
The key items:
a) App to gather the info
b) Authority dash (for judges, parole, etc - Backend for authorities to see what is happening)
c) Participant Dash (so participants can see how they are doing - will look different from the authority dash)
SECOND ROUND:
- Good to go to simplist path and shortest time frame, so good to hand off a clear illustration, eg
a) an app for the participants, even if only one or two buttons (help and schedule)
b) dashboard of what it would look like the judge, etc
c) dash of what it would look like for the participants
- Can't do this without the judge and experts, so we shoudl ask the judge and others to get some help to assist us in defining these requirements and context. 
- We'll find the informal way is usually excel spreadsheets... so let's find this out.  If we do the informal thing and it captures imagination.. it can be a siuccess!
- An app w/2 button connected to one users data and two simple dash boards would be great.
- Need at least one person from the judge's team.


4. Lina:
-
-
-
- Identify grant funding and project - but is best thing for us to take it to funder soon?  to think it through and then take it to funding?  
- Important to have a chairperson who has experience w/software dev who can indicate direction.
SECOND: pass.

5. Josh
- Build a prototype is our outcome 
- We need to be explicit about the applicable standards and requirements of the courts and stakeholders...

SECOND:
- Need an MVP that we can hand off to the judge... 
- Also good idea to reach out to funders. 

6. Eric 
- Not much to add right now... but it's important to ask 
- Where will we find the devices?
