Round the Horn on Perspectives on How Best to Move Forward:

1. Dazza: Suggest we do the (now current first draft) statement in the GitHub repo PLUS a healthy amount of prototypes (MIT UROPS and partners etc) 

2. Dan: Need to build some code and there is an opportunity to get some funding and resources to make progress.  Let's do that.  

3. Joyce: Key is to develop as much as possible bottom up and light weight, not a big vendor.  
The key items:
a) App to gather the info
b) Authority dash (for judges, parole, etc - Backend for authorities to see what is happening)
c) Participant Dash (so participants can see how they are doing - will look different from the authority dash)

4. Lina:
-
-
-
- Identify grant funding and project - but is best thing for us to take it to funder soon?  to think it through and then take it to funding?  
- Important to have a chairperson who has experience w/software dev who can indicate direction.
