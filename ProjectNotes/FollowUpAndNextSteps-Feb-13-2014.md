Next meeting: Tue, Feb 18, 4pm EST.  Cal w/Hangout Sent.

Notes: [GitHub Notes](https://github.com/LegalScience/ReEntry/blob/master/ProjectNotes/Notes-1stPrepCall-Feb13.md)

Next Steps:


 #1: Draft "Project Plan"
Need a basic statement with expected:
a) Thinking of a three month project around spring semester timing
b) Perhaps a monthly pulse for meeting of Judge Aiken and key stakeholders in role of a "steering cmt" who can see and give feedback on the plan for deliverables
c) Intent to get feedback on what functions would be most valuable from Judge Aiken and her key team and to create an MVP prototype 
i) Functionality ideas: Maybe limited buttons and a participant and judicial dash operating as a proof of concept on common existing data types and software environment), perhaps in a "spring semester" time frame.
ii) Getting code done ideas: perhaps with MIT UROPS working with Dazza and Lina according to the design/wireframes, etc from our group and agreed by the steering cmt.  Also can bring this to subsequent hackathons or invite coders from Code for America, etc to take on parts of the coding during the semester, etc.  
#2: Invite/Convene expert advisory panel of great technologists, attorneys and others to provide feedback (eg my California criminal defense lawyer friend Matthew Siroka of the DefenderGroup, etc)
#3:  Invite Judge Aiken to view draft plan (item #1) and advise on next steps, 

My (Dazza) sense of the content of the email would be to include a draft plan and pose the explicit question in email to her:
a) would she like as a next step to work with us via email and/or on our call this Tue the 18th at 4pm EST or another time soon to iterate the basic plan, OR
b)  if she likes the plan "as is" and the next step is for us to get the plan to the next phase of launch readiness (eg with an app design, some coders lined up, etc) and to convene Judge Aiken and stakeholders in about a month to review and feedback on initial prototype.
c) something else?
