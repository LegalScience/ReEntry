Updated Meeting Agenda: 

ReEntryApp 2/25 Agenda for Sync with Judge Aiken


1. Update and Proposed Plan: 

Had meeting after Hackathon and refined a plan to conduct a “Design and Rapid Prototype” phase.  The draft project plan is now available at https://github.com/LegalScience/ReEntry/blob/master/ProjectPlan/ProjectPlan.md 

   * Design-Phase Project team (team from Hackathon agreed to stick together for this) describes achievable mobile app design and attracts MIT students, hackathon participants, etc to help rapid prototype.  Design phase is lightweight, volunteer and intended to be about 3 months featuring three major meetings: 1) Kick Off, 2) Review Session and 3) Final Presentation/HandOff.  Online (Phone/Hangout/etc) With Judge Aiken presiding  over Stakeholder/Experts to Review/Feedback.

   * Design-Phase Stakeholder Committee Led by Judge Aiken:  Leverage design phase to recruit and engage stakeholders that can take ownership/leadership and provide critical feedback on needed functionality and technical interoperability requirements. The stakeholder group is intended to provide an informal forum to: 

        - contain the volunteer project team and Judge Aiken’s collaboration on rapid prototype of app and 
        - that key stakeholders and experts can join to provide input/feedback on what the app should do and 
        - that can legitimately take leadership of further development/testing/piloting/etc 

  * End of Design Phase: 
      - Final Presentation and Opportunity for Pilot-Phase Launch
      - Account transfer and ownership assignment of the GitHub organization within which the repositories (both public and private) containing all project data, work flow (ie via issues tickets, authorization roles for accounts of contributors and other participants, open source licenses, etc). 
      - Hand-Off: It is also anticipated that the hand-off will include a Google Hangout for a “final presentation” using slides, screen share, video and/or other online methods to walk through the deliverables and repositories, discuss/questions

2. Requested Feedback from Judge Aiken:
  
 * Ask: Are you ok with this general approach or have any changes?
      - Note changes requested
* Set Tentative Date/Time for initial “Project Kick-Off Meeting” 

3. Any Other Business?  Close.


AUX ITEMS (Time Permitting):
      * Schedule dates/times for all three planned project meetings.
      * Ask: Who should be invited to committee and their contact info?
      * Define how/when it is appropriate to expect Judge’s involvement (minimally at the three big project meetings)
      * Ask Judge Aiken what “Parole Officer” button is intended to do
      * Request Judge Aiken resend slide deck or other project document to help guide us in development and in shaping our pitch to interested third parties (e.g. Ford Foundation)


--------------------
Prior Calendar Meeting Notes Follow:

Purpose: To discuss with and receive feedback from Judge Aiken on the plan for 3 month Design and Rapid Prototype Phase for the ReEntryApp project. The members of the Feb 8/9 Legal Hackathon team will lead the initiative and  MIT Media Lab's Computational Legal Science research team will host and convene this phase.  

Timing: We understand this will be during a lunch break on a trial day, so it is absolutely fine to just join for a few minutes at some point during the 12 - 1pm PST period.  30 minutes or more would be ideal, but we can address the key issues needed for us to kick-off this project in as little as 15 minutes if necessary.
