Problem Description
[WOULD LIKE TO PULL THIS FROM JUDGE AIKEN’S DECK OR ELSEWHERE; MAY ALSO MAKE SENSE TO MERGE THIS WITH THE “BACKGROUND” SECTION]
Project/Application Summary
Build prototype application to provide technological aspect of innovative re-entry/recidivism prevention program.  The project will also include an associated court-facing or parole officer-facing module that will allow the court/parole officer to track the individual’s progress, real-time movements, and to provide timely strategic interventions to help reduce recidivism.  
Background
In recent years Judge Aiken, Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District Court of Oregon, has implemented an innovative re-entry program in which the “re-entrant” (the “individual”) the court, and the parole officer work closely to support the IND’s efforts to avoid recidivism. Participants in this program have demonstrated a 16% reduction in recidivism as compared with participants in standard re-entry programs.
This innovative program is based upon limiting the following five criminogenic factors that have been shown to correlate to increased recidivism. Specifically:

1.Substance Abuse
2. Mental Health
3. Education
4. Family Environment
5. Employment

The program emphasizes personal responsibility for the individual and is based upon the core values of “Trust, Transparency, and Truth.”
Application Description
This project will use technology to implement the same principles that Judge Aiken successfully applied in her recidivism prevention program. Specifically, the application will feature five (or six?) key functionalities:
Crisis
Me
Job
Communication
Schedule
Please see the simple wireframe in Attachment A to this document showing a sample UI for the application homescreen.
Each of these key functionalities is tied to a criminogenic recidivism factor. The app is designed to help reduce the incidence of each criminogenic factor in an individual’s life and, thereby, hopefully limit a given individual’s tendency to recidivate. 
Each tab is discussed below:
Crisis: This tab will provide the individual with immediate contact with a parole officer or other support.
Me: This tab will consist of two main pieces.
- First: A status tracker which will enable the individual to monitor their progress against key criminogenic factors manifest in the application.
- Second: Access for the participant to contact information for their family, friends, and other loved ones
Job: This tab will connect the individual with employment resources such as job posts, networking opportunities, and education modules. These modules and resources may be able to be customized depending upon the individual’s needs and skills.
Communication: This tab will provide the individual with access to text functionality to parole officer and volunteer support individuals as well as, potentially, counsellors and other contacts.
Schedule: In this module the individual will have access to a calendaring function. The parole officer or other official will be able to push calendaring events to the individual’s application. Pushed events will include random and scheduled urinalysis appointments, counseling visits (both group and individual), family visitation opportunities (if applicable), court dates, probation “check-in” appointments and others. The individual will also be able to schedule their own events. The receipt of push notifications will be made prominently visible throughout the application UI and reminders for important events will also surface on the homescreen and, possibly, in other places in the app.
Parole Office Module: The court or parole officer-facing module will provide the parole officer with real-time insight into the activities and progress of the individual. Most if not all information visible to the individual in the application will be visible to the parole officer, including the individual’s use of the application and activity. The parole officer module will be combined with “big data” analytics across all program participants and other criminogenic research to try an discern when certain activities by a specific individual in the program may indicate a likelihood for that individual to commit a crime. This will give the courts and parole officer an opportunity to intervene in strategic instances to try to support the individual and help to reduce recidivism.  
Development:
The application will be developed using an API-Based Open Network. This will allow for continued development in a distributed fashion and customization to the specific requirements of federal, state, and local courts. The application will be device agnostic/web applications.
Timeline
Design Phase – March 2014 – April 2014
Length: Approximately
Deliverables:
Transmission of Deliverables:
A markdown file describing a conceptual design architecture for this App,
A prototype file demonstrating the user experience and other key featured, functions and flows of the App (this may be based on interactive wireframes or may include working code), and
Transfer of Project Repositories:
Account transfer and ownership assignment of the GitHub organization within which the repositories (both public and private) containing all project data, work flow (ie via issues tickets, authorization roles for accounts of contributors and other participants, open source licenses, etc). It is also anticipated that the hand-off will include a Google Hangout for a presentation using slides, screen share, video and/or other online methods to walk through the deliverables and repositories, discuss the project and respond to questions.
What other phases do we have?
